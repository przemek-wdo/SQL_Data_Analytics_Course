# Introduction
This is my first SQL project in my portfolio. It’s based on the database from the “SQL for Data Analytics” course by Luke Barousse and Kelly J. Adams.

This project represents my personal deep dive into the data jobs market of Poland— I’m exploring data analyst roles, top-paying skills, and the most in-demand skills to find the intersection of the most valuable things to learn that could help me land my first data job.

Feel free to check out and explore my SQL queries here: [Project SQL files](/project_sql/).

# Background
The main goal of this project was to understand the current global job market for data roles, with a focus on Data Analyst positions. As I’m just starting my journey in Data Analysis, exploring the most valuable skills to learn seemed both practical and insightful. Analyzing real job data for this role was also a great way to practice my SQL and data analysis skills while gaining meaningful insights into the current job market.

# Tools used
Tools used during this project:

- **SQL:** The main language of the project, used for practicing queries and data analysis.

- **PostgreSQL:** Database management system used to operate on the locally installed database.

- **Visual Studio Code:** The environment for writing, managing, and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub:** Mainly used as a platform for sharing the project, and also to get more familiar with version control and collaborative workflows.
# The Analysis
Below are the key questions that guided my analysis and each one is explored through a dedicated SQL query.
1. **What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?**

To identify the highest-paying positions, I filtered Data Analyst roles located in Poland and ordered them by average yearly salary in descending order. This approach provides insight into the top-paying opportunities within the field of Data Analysis. Additionally, I used a ```LEFT JOIN``` to attach company information and gain a more complete overview of each job posting.

``` sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location LIKE '%Poland%'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

Key insights from the query results:

- *Wide salary range:* As expected, the salary spread is quite large, depending on experience level and required skills. Within the top 1,000 records, yearly salaries range from around $40,000 to $165,000 — more than a 4x difference between the lowest and highest-paying roles.

- *The capital pays the most:* Among the 19 job postings with salaries above $100K, 9 are based in Warsaw, and 6 are listed as “Poland” (likely remote offers).

- *Local big player:* Of those 19 high-paying roles, 8 are offered by Allegro — a major Polish e-commerce platform.


2. **What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?**

To get better view of what skills are required for top-paying jobs, I joined skills data with job postings. To reduce amount of results, I filtered them down to only those posts, where yearly salary is over $100k so the skills shown applies to highest-paying roles giving me more future-proof look of what skills are going to grow on popularity in the future. 
``` sql
 WITH top_paying_jobs AS
        (
            SELECT
                job_id,
                job_title,
                name AS company_name,
                job_location,
                job_schedule_type,
                salary_year_avg,
                job_posted_date
            FROM 
                job_postings_fact
                LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
            WHERE 
                job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
                job_location LIKE '%Poland%' AND
                salary_year_avg > 100000
            ORDER BY 
                salary_year_avg DESC
        )

    SELECT 
        top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills
    FROM 
        top_paying_jobs
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
    ORDER BY top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC
```

*The chart above (quickly generated by ChatGPT, based on exported *.csv file) shows the top 10 most frequently mentioned skills among Data Analyst positions offering over $100K yearly salary.*



Key takeaways for this query:

- *SQL dominates high-paying roles:* Appearing in 14 listings, SQL remains the foundational skill for Data Analysts, regardless of company or industry.

- **Visualization and BI tools matter* – Tools like Tableau (11 mentions), Looker (5), and Power BI (3) highlight the growing demand for analysts who can communicate insights visually.

- *Cloud and big data skills boost salaries* – Skills such as Spark and GCP (6 mentions each) and Airflow (5) indicate that experience with scalable data infrastructure is increasingly valuable for top-tier positions.

3. **What skills are most in demand for data analysts?**

Using the following query, I identified the most frequently mentioned skills in Data Analyst job postings. To achieve this, I joined the job and skills datasets using an ```INNER JOIN```. Since the number of job postings per skill is the key metric here, I ordered the results in descending order — showing the most in-demand skills at the top — and limited the output to the top 10.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location LIKE '%Poland%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Unlike the previous query, this one is based on all job postings, not just those offering over $100K per year. The results show that, in general, not only SQL or big data technologies matter — **Excel still dominates as the primary and most accessible tool** for performing fundamental analytical tasks.

4. **Which skills are associated with higher salaries?**

While exploring which skills are linked to higher salaries, I decided to exclude those that are very niche and appear only once or twice in the dataset. Such specialized skills are less relevant for someone starting a career as a Data Analyst.
Therefore, in addition to the standard aggregation (```AVG```) and join (```INNER JOIN```) operations, the query also includes a ```HAVING``` clause that filters for skills appearing in at least five job postings.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location LIKE '%Poland%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 5
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC;

```

The main conclusion from this query is that the highest salaries are associated with **Big Data technologies** such as Spark and Airflow. These tools are typically used in large-scale data processing and automation, which likely explains their higher market value.

5.**What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?**
The answer to this final — and most important — question combines insights from the previous two analyses. To identify the most valuable skills, I focused on those that appear frequently in job postings and are also associated with higher salaries.

To achieve this, I joined functionality of both queries with the use of **CTE's**, isolating the skills that are both in high demand and highly rewarded. This approach highlights the intersection of popularity and profitability — the most strategic area to focus on for anyone starting a career in data analytics.

``` sql
WITH 
    demanded_skills as 
    (
        SELECT 
            skills_dim.skills,
            skills_dim.skill_id,
            COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
        FROM job_postings_fact
            INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
            INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
        WHERE
            job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
            job_location LIKE '%Poland%' AND
            salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY
            skills_dim.skills,
            skills_dim.skill_id
        ORDER BY
            demand_count DESC
    ),
    averaged_salary as
    (
        SELECT 
            skills_dim.skills,
            skills_dim.skill_id,
            ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
        FROM job_postings_fact
            INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
            INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
        WHERE
            job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
            job_location LIKE '%Poland%' AND
            salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY
            skills_dim.skills,
            skills_dim.skill_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 5
        ORDER BY
            COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) DESC
    )

SELECT
    demanded_skills.skills,
    demand_count,
    averaged_salary.avg_salary
FROM
    demanded_skills
INNER JOIN averaged_salary ON demanded_skills.skill_id = averaged_salary.skill_id
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
```

![Print screen of the query results](assets\02.png)  
*Results of the query presenting both demand count and average salary associated with particular skills.*

**Key Insights:**


- *Highest Demand:* Excel (64), Power BI (53), SAP (48).

- *Highest Average Salaries:* Spark - $107,250; Airflow - $103,700

- *High Demand / Lower Salary (Potential “Must-Haves”):* Skills like Excel and DAX are in very high demand but appears also in job posts with lower average salaries. These represent essential, widely required tools for most analyst roles.

- *Low Demand / High Salary (Potential “Niche or Specialized Skills”):* Skills such as Spark and Airflow appear in fewer job postings but are associated with the highest salaries, indicating strong value in more specialized areas.

# Conclusion

**Insights**

This analysis shows that while foundational skills like **Excel**, **SQL** and **Power BI** remain essential for most data analyst positions, learning specialized tools such as **Spark** or **Airflow** can significantly increase salary potential.

The most optimal learning path lies at the intersection of high-demand and high-value skills — a balanced combination of core analytics tools and modern data technologies.

**Things I learned**

During this project, I focused on practicing SQL as it was an integral part of the **SQL for Data Analytics** course by Luke Barousse and Kelly J. Adams. Being one of the final exercises in the course, it allowed me to apply the most important SQL commands and concepts commonly used by Data Analysts — such as SELECT, different types of **JOINS, CTEs, aggregation functions, grouping, and ordering**, to name just a few of those most frequently used throughout this project.

This marks the beginning of my journey with data. The most valuable takeaway for me is realizing how engaging working with data can be — and it definitely motivates me to keep exploring new opportunities in this field.

**Closing thoughts**

This project was an excellent opportunity to combine SQL practice with real-world data exploration.

In the next steps, I plan to integrate Python and data visualization tools (most likely Power BI) to deepen insights and create more visually engaging reports. My goal is to use the knowledge gained here to guide my learning path and move closer to landing my first data analytics role.
